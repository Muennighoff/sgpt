## Cross-Encoder on BEIR (Inference)

### Structure

Notebook overview:

- `crossencoder_beir_bm25`: Creating BM25 results on BEIR 
- `crossencoder_beir_sgpt`: Creating SGPT reranking results based on BM25 results (Note: If you do not want to rerun BM25, you can download the BM25 results from the datasets provided, see the Downloads section for more information.)
- `crossencoder_bioasq_bm25`: Parsing of the BioASQ dataset & running it with BM25 - This dataset is 21GB in size & requires some specific processing, hence the separate notebook. Run it on a large RAM instance to avoid BM25 running out of memory.
- `crossencoder_openai`: Scoring the OpenAI semantic search endpoint on BEIR (This is not the embedding endpoint, but (most likely) a Cross Encoder based endpoint)
- `../other/sgpt_utils`: Various utils for compouting re-ranking scores & graphs for the SGPT paper (The code is partly duplicated in `crossencoder_beir_sgpt`)

You can use these BM25 results to benchmark your own re-ranker on BEIR without having to re-run BM25 + It will be easily comparable to all results in the SGPT paper :)
